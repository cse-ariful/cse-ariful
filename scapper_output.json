        "Wow! I've used many apps and all of them were never as easy as this app to compress. I wanted to preview the video as it was compressed before pressing done so I opted for the free trial and I was very impressed with the results of my video. It didn't lose the music background to the video, the quality of the video was excellent. Thank you!",
        "this video compression is really good (62mb -> 2mb and in 6 sec with good quality), and all the quick options are perfect; they even show the frame rate and resolutions the file is currently in on the drop down list. you can completely customize bitrate, frame rate, resolution, all file types are free (maybe consider adding .webm?), and the ads come while your file is compressing which is very acceptable. 5 stars easily. 6th star for including batch background compression - Worth purchasing.",
        "I use this app for videos i need to email or text. Its effective in making the videos dramatically smaller. I have only needed it a few times so i cant speak on all the settings or any comparisons to similar apps. Its worked for me well enough that i havent downloaded anything related since. Im also a real person and just wanted to offer feedback to people who are browsing around and unfamiliar, as i am, with this function.",
        "Updated - App works as intended however if you try to or accidentally import a file before you confirm your previous compressed file within the app, that file gets erased and you have to start the compression over again even if it takes several hours to complete. Checked the outputs and wasn't there, checked through the stock file app and wasn't there. The app said it was done compressing so it should automatically save the file to your phone. But you have to manually do it regardless.",
        "My experience in using this app for running videos through was pretty simple all the way, with many options on how you want the video to come out on the end. The ads weren't intrusive either, thankfully none of them being a video ad to slow the process.",
        "This app has good options for compression for free (I used HEVC), but the number of ads it shows to use premium features for compressing a video are annoying: many 30 second long wait ads for individual feature toggles. I'd prefer for ads to appear at the end of the compression process instead of when each option is toggled. I prefer another compression app that only shows 1 ad at the end of the compression.",
        "ads, Ads, ADS! Often 2 at once! MANY full screen ads 5-30sec. BUT COMPRESSION looks GOOD. After compression, you have to press tiny buttons Many TIMES & Wait for response. Most TEXT is too SMALL to READ. Even in your UPSELL AD! OPTIONS are good. -Some options need explanation: -In batch mode, what is Audio: All vs First?? -What is H265 Normal(small) vs Fast(large) vs Fastest(largest)?? Fast but largest file? Are they all same quality? -Explain how files are renamed in Batch processing!!",
        "Excellent app, does what it says it does and allows you to watch ads instead of requiring you upgrade to the pro version which is both a more mature and reasonable means of including ads in an app. Without watching the ads you are limited to three videos at a time, but that's reasonable for those avoiding ads I would. I'm extremely impressed with the compression functionality as well, works well on moderate hardware even. 10/10",
        "Great app. Thank you. It reduced a 10gb video down to 1.3gb (I opted for high sound quality). The compressed file was virtually indistinguishable from the original, the sound was actually louder. There are periodic non invasive ads during the compression process, but no watermark on the video. I'm sure it takes a lot of memory to work so charge your phone for big files. So far no bugs. No surprise fees.Intuitive interface. Takes up little space on my low end phone. Thank you for the service.",
        "I have a One Plus 7 Pro that's capable of recording videos at 4K at 60 fps. The one thing that I like about this app is that it solved my problem with spacing issues. What I mean by this is that usually whenever I record a video at those settings, the size of the video is extremely large and when I want to share it, it was a hassle because I had lower the quality of my videos in order to share them. Thankfully, this app was able to let me compress my videos and keep my video quality!",
        "I don't usually rate apps but this is very good. I'm extremely pleased. I'm not very smart so I was afraid it would be difficult to use but it's very easy. Compresses videos perfectly and now I can share them on Discord. Note though that the free version has a lot of loud ads, just be aware and turn your volume down/mute if you need to! I paid for the lifetime ad-free because it is worth it for me.",
        "Clean interface, good selection of options and codecs, and the ads are present but not intrusive or overly burdensome. Pro features unlock temporarily for watching a 30 sec ad spot, which in today's app marketplace seems a reasonable tradeoff and preferable to some other developers' approach. Program is functional as advertised, I've not had any errors in the year or so I've used it, and isn't a resource hog. Good choice for low-loss compression to make videos textable, but still watchable.",
        "I tried all file size compressions and even at the lowest resolution, video looks good when attached to text message. I would go with the High Quality in HD if you want to save space in your phone. I'd be comfortable deleting my original video files after compression. I recommend this free app even with ads ( only 1 ad before you can start to compress).",
        "Very good video compression app. I would give a full 5 stars on the program, its features and functionality. But it loses a point in its choice of ad inclusion. Uses pop-up and full page ads that interfere with the functionality of the app. Why not small banner ads at they bottom of the screen, guys? They pay less? But don't reviews like this hurt your overall downloads?",
        "I originally gave 4 stars but since they did respond by contacting me I will now give them a 5 stars. My recommendation was the app should warn the user when it is 'busy processing'. An easy fix to include in a future version. Below is the original 4 star comment. Intuitive to use out of the box. Would give 5 stars but for 1 reason. The 2nd time it ran it was on a 100 mb MP4 and the app appeared to get stuck and froze stating 'extracting file info'. After waiting 60 seconds I aborted the app. It may have been busy processing, no way to easily know. If instead the app showed me a progress bar it would have clarified if it is truly running fine or frozen/stuck.",
        "I was very concerned compressing my videos would decrease the quality, but my fears were unwarranted! This app is easy to use, and works fairly quickly. I've had one clip that didn't save after it was done compressing, and I haven't figured that out yet, but otherwise it's worked perfectly.",
        "I just downloaded this compressor today because I maxed out my Google photos space and needed to make some room.. In about 5 minutes, I compressed 20 videos down (for free) to a significantly smaller file size I compared one of my old videos to the new compressed version and they looked and sounded identical. This couldn't have been an easier, more user friendly experience. I am impressed and will update if anything changes. Thank you!",
        "Great ap. Wonderfully simple abd clean UI. Has option for custom compression, but also has like 7 presets to choose from, in case youre not sure how to manually achieve your goal. Tried a few other dismal aps before i tried this one. This was a breath of fresh air. Good work, creators. I do have a question for the creators, if they see this. Is the \"lifetime\" premium really just that? A one time purchase?",
        "This is one of those ugly-yet-useful apps. Pretty impressive, does its job extremely well. I'd complain about the amount of space taken up with advertising, but I'm probably just nitpicking cos I'm pretty sure the ads never got in my way at all. They just ugly. The \"bottom line\" is this compressor has done the best job out of the zillions I've tried. Massive reduction in file size -- even with the largest option -- whilst retaining more quality than one should reasonably expect. Surprise!",
        "Really decent. Lots of formats. I paid for premium. It seems that across certain handsets and message carriers from Signal to WhatsApp not everyone could see my edited video messages, and to be fair I think I've managed to use this app to where all messages I send now are viewable and the file sizes can be as big or small as I choose them to be. Good stuff.",
        "I love this app to be honest. The best video compressor I've come across so far. Just a little problem. In my own experience, Video somehow skips some miniseconds at the beginning of play and I also get a little glitch sound at the beginning of play too. Please if this can be fixed it'll be awesome. Will love to give five star. Adds seem fair to me.",
        "Fast download and very easy to use first time using it but I can deffinetly say Im going to keep using it as well. It does take a bit of time with large files esp. But is a good trade with the amount of saved memory on my cell and now I can upload my videos to FB that were previously way to large to upload talking about gigabytes to megabytes thank you ap develoupers for a Gr8 tool...",
        "I'm not sure if it's a mistake but the compressed videos turn out with higher brightness or contrast, therefore certain gray or light-colored colors become totally white getting lost, I hope you can read this and review it please.",
        "Perfect, but why there is a bad music in the background ?? Since 2 or 3 months, the app started to play a horrible music in the background, and there is no way to mute it. Why?? it is very strange and odd. Plz fix it.",
        "Very user friendly and easy.Whatever the reason, the app couldn't compress the video upto 16 MB(WhatsApp compatible) in the customisation option.It could compress upto 22MB.Re-compression of 22MB gave 25MB size in the end result!! But overall, it is a good app.",
        "Bought the \"One time purchase\" Love this app, used for months, it works like a charm and I use it too often, the Ads are fair, you get one coming in, get one at the end, I decided to pay because I use this too frequently for all that. Ads are short thankfully but compared to other similar apps, they aren't constantly popping up randomly, and they're not ruining app experience. Thanks dev.",
        "This is the best video compressor app that is being allowed to be used free of cost spending few seconds only in watching relevant ads. I must thank the developer for helping people like me who could not afford to purchase these apps as a beginner.",
        "Wow I actually just compressed a 4k video to unbelievable compression, even in HD that's to tell you that this app is the best to compress videos without any problems and it even works in the background so you don't have to be in the app for the compression to be going on",
        "Excellent video compressor. Even with small files you have the option to select HD quality for the reduced size. I love it and purchased a yearly subscribtion.",
        "The fit to size feature never does the desired file size, it always goes way over. Need files to be smaller than 8mb for discord and I'll even set it to 7mb but it'll turn a 10mb into 8.5mb? Needs option to change to fit below max size limit. Ads can also interrupt the compression process by slowing it down dramatically or even freezing the app.",
        "Excellent software for converting and compressing videos of different formats. With numerous batch file operations, a mobile fan cooler Dock can help with any heat-related problems on large files. Bonus: There is now a discount on this version of Video Compressor - thanks to the developers working on it.",
        "Wonderful! I needed to compress a video to send in an email and from the start of me downloading this app to the finished product didn't even take 5 minutes and it shows you all of the information you need like how big the file was to what it is compressed down to! Great app!",
        "Exactly what I was looking for. I have a OnePlus 8T, one problem I have is that no matter if I record at 30 or 60 fps, social media destroys it, crisp images and flawless quality turns into choppy and pixelated... I wanted something that allowed me to compress the quality just a bit, and this program does exactly that, the ads can be a bit annoying, but devs gotta eat too! Fast, easy to use and delivers what it promises, highly recommend.",
        "One of the best compressors I have used, even with the ads. It's reliable and consistent, provided if you don't get annoyed with the ads.",
        "Very much satisfied with the results. I was able to compress the video from 315MB to 13 MB without losing quality. Thank you very much for making such an amazing app.",
        "Does what it says on the tin with ads and a couple of trips on the way to using some features but free version is good and of used often worth it's digital weight in sure.",
        "Perfect app! The only ads that pop up are after you compress your video, which is more than fair. I use this so I can upload videos to Discord, since it has a 10mb limit and this app compresses even 50mb videos below that limit, and even lower if you don't mind losing too much quality. For 20mb videos, compressing to 5mb doesn't lose any noticeable quality to the untrained eye. I'm a professional editor too and always render videos in 4K, so trust me when it comes to quality. Perfect app!",
        "Does the job. Quick and easy to compress multiple video files. Hope they can enhance and add option to replace old large file with the smaller compressed ones.",
        "Compresses videos without quality loss. Provides various options for compression. After compression, the option to compare both videos is the best.",
        "This is one of the app that support H265 compression which is super efficient, just need more time and computation power. Quality came out is super good. Bless my google photos storage quota."
